                    SPANNER WINGNUT'S MUDDLEWARE LABS
                    ---------------------------------

    This is a GitHub-hosted edition of the BlunderDome/wingnut sandbox
    for experimentation and confirmation of blogging customizations,
    archiving, and preservation.
    This scaffolding, and further arrangements are a case of document
    engineering applied to the wingnut project and site themselves.

 TODO

  * This will be the publication staging folder when publication is handled
    by generation under a framework such as Hugo.  The extra stage is to
    allow review at the authoring location so only publish-ready material is
    brought here when the time comes.

  * This will also preserve materials that are already in HTML, having been
    authored with Microsoft FrontPage and various blogging engines.

  * This is a variation on the site-server model.  This will be documented
    on docEng.

  * It is fair to have this site document the construction of this site
    and all the gyrations involved to extract previous wingnut content for
    access as orcmid.github.io/wingnut.

  * Confirm that legacy construction structure is preserved here and the
    index.html pages pre-empting the construction-structure index.htm.  It
    also matters what happens with default.htm pages.

  * For wingnut, it is appropriate for publishing framework materials that
    will be the authoring source be made part of the orcmid/wingnut project.
    This will depend on the fact that we are generating static pages from
    static authoring content, typically some form of markdown.  We do not
    intent to directly author in the docs/ folder but there may well have to
    be maintenance of legacy pages, especially with regard to relative and
    absolute uses of URLs.

  * I am going to explore hugo and the hugo-books template with KaTeX support.

  * Add Apache license and notices page ??  - It goes with the project, what
    about the site?

  * I really want to have a sandbox for trying different web-site frameworks
    and generation methods.  Maybe I need to move spanner wingnut to GitHub?
    This might be the safest thing.  Put it in a separate project so I can
    migrate it different ways and have it all work.  I can also look at what
    I did in the hexo case, and with the test files for hexo cases.

  * Complete the current construction structure and the about and then also
    use the construction folder to document the framework(s) used, if
    desired.

  * Bringing over the BlunderDome/wingnut/index.htm page as saved into a file
    by Edge confirms that index.htm is not taken as default with the GitHub
    Pages web server.

  * There is a problem with wingnut accessing the orcmid.com construction
    structure, it seems.  I must verify that.  If it is its own, I can deal
    with that.  I also need to know whether the change of relative references
    in the page were changed to absolute references when Edge save the file
    or not.  I will create issues about this and figure out the next steps.

  * The BlunderDome/wingnut construction structure is seriously connected to
    orcmid.com in many respects.  I should be able to work around some or all
    of that as long as I don't have to monkey with it too much.  I can fix
    pages using FrontPage though have no clue that it will work on Windows 10.
    If I do it on quadro, I will have to deal with re-extraction to the GitHub
    project.  Though I guess that is not so tricky because it will look like
    changed files and I can commit them.  I just have to avoid creating
    collisions with myself.

  * I also need to see whether default.htm[l] has any significance in a folder
    of GitHub pages.

  * I also need to see where the Orcmid's Lair and Construction Zone images
    are fetched from and can I accomplish the same thing.  There may be a
    problem of construction not being in the right place, or the images not
    being in the right place.  I should be able to fix that in FrontPage.

  * DANGER DANGER We have orcmid/BlunderDome/wingnut so this doesn't line up
    with wingnut/docs with docs the equivalent of the root.  The problem is
    not so much with the content of wingnut/ as it is with the reliance on
    higher-level locations, such as orcmid/construction, even though those are
    accessed by relative references.

  * AN ALTERNATIVE: I could create an orcmid/docs/ project with the host of
    that basically orcmid.github.io/ itself I think.  That would grab
    orcmid's lair.  It is a preservation move but not a great way to continue
    wingnut as a sandbox.

  * BETTER ALTERNATIVE: Create BlunderDome/wingnut/construction and create the
    necessary elements there.  This means fixing the FrontPage includes to
    use that construction material and also fix the construction structure
    to link to that construction material.  That is something I can do though.

  * BETTER THAN THAT: Maybe I don't need to preserve WingNut.  I can clean-
    sheet it as the GitHub-oriented version.

  * I also need to check whether a private GitHub repository can have a public
    Pages site.
