                    ---------------------------------

    This is a GitHub-hosted edition of the BlunderDome/wingnut sandbox
    for experimentation and confirmation of blogging customizations,
    archiving, and preservation.
    This scaffolding, and further arrangements are a case of document
    engineering applied to the wingnut project and site themselves.

 TODO

  * This will be the publication staging folder when publication is handled
    by generation under a framework such as Hugo.  The extra stage is to
    allow review at the authoring location so only publish-ready material is
    brought here when the time comes.

  * This will also preserve materials that are already in HTML, having been
    authored with Microsoft FrontPage and various blogging engines.

  * This is a variation on the site-server model.  This will be documented
    on docEng.

  * It is fair to have this site document the construction of this site
    and all the gyrations involved to extract previous wingnut content for
    access as orcmid.github.io/wingnut.

  * Determine if legacy construction structure is preserved here and the
    index.html pages pre-empting the construction-structure index.htm.  It
    also matters what happens with default.htm pages.

  * For wingnut, it is appropriate for publishing framework materials that
    will be the authoring source be made part of the orcmid/wingnut project.
    This will depend on the fact that we are generating static pages from
    static authoring content, typically some form of markdown.  We do not
    intent to directly author in the docs/ folder but there may well have to
    be maintenance of legacy pages, especially with regard to relative and
    absolute uses of URLs.

  * I am going to explore hugo and the hugo-books template with KaTeX support.

  * Add Apache license and notices page ??  - It goes with the project, what
    about the site?

  * I really want to have a sandbox for trying different web-site frameworks
    and generation methods.  Maybe I need to move spanner wingnut to GitHub?
    This might be the safest thing.  Put it in a separate project so I can
    migrate it different ways and have it all work.  I can also look at what
    I did in the hexo case, and with the test files for hexo cases.

  * Complete the current construction structure and the about and then also
    use the construction folder to document the framework(s) used, if
    desired.
